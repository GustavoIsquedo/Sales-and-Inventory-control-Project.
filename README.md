# Sales-and-Inventory-control-Project.
This project consists of an inventory control system focused on the management of dietary supplements, developed in Python as part of an academic assessment for the Basic Software course at the University of Mogi das Cruzes (UMC). The application runs entirely through the terminal and was designed with an emphasis on usability, visual clarity, and robust data handling.It leverages libraries such as colorama for visual styling of messages and menus, and tabulate for structured and visually appealing data presentation in table format. The system offers a smooth and intuitive user experience, featuring product registration with input validation, product updates and removals, the generation of tabulated reports that highlight low-stock items, and a smart search function by product name. All data is stored locally in a .txt file, ensuring data integrity and continuity across sessions.With a modular structure and careful use of resources such as regular expressions and file handling, the system showcases a practical application of programming fundamentals and flow control, combining simplicity of execution with a refined visual finish tailored for terminal environments.The project was developed by Gustavo Galvão, Lucas Cavalcante, and Lucas Rodrigues, as part of their Software Engineering program, and reflects a strong commitment to clean code practices, structural clarity, and user experience — even in command-line applications.
